# Captcha_Solver
Basic introduction to captcha solver with existed data

This project is designed for automatic CAPTCHA recognition and solving. The project includes the following files and directories:

- captcha_solver.py: Main script for CAPTCHA recognition.
- Captcha_generation.py: Script for generating CAPTCHA images.
- test/ and train/ directories: Folders containing test and training data for the model.
- requirements.txt: List of required libraries for installation.

## Requirements

Ensure that all the necessary dependencies listed in requirements.txt are installed on your system. You can install them using a package manager like pip.

## Project Contents

### captcha_solver.py

This script is the core part of the project. It processes CAPTCHA images by applying preprocessing steps and uses a trained model to recognize the text within the CAPTCHA.

### Captcha_generation.py

This script generates random CAPTCHA images. It allows you to specify parameters such as the number of images to generate and the directory where they will be saved.

### Data

#### train/ directory

Contains CAPTCHA images used for training the model.

#### test/ directory

Contains CAPTCHA images used for testing the modelâ€™s accuracy.

### requirements.txt

A list of all required libraries for the project. You can install these dependencies using a package manager.

## Training the Model

The project includes functionality to train a model using generated CAPTCHA data. You can specify the training dataset, number of epochs, and other parameters to customize the training process.

## Testing the Model

The trained model can be tested on a separate dataset of CAPTCHA images to evaluate its performance.
